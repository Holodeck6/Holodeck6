Chapter One

**Counter Paranormal Agency (CPA) Midwest Bureau**

Greg Black was vehemently stalking the first row of computer stations, a cup of coffee in one hand and a tablet in the other. An analyst was crouched over each workstation, studying the raw data and field reports which were flowing into the CPA's servers.

Greg glanced up at the 100 inch display which was currently split up into four different quadrants. Each quadrant was showing live drone footage. "Any signs of her?" he asked, glancing sideways at the scruffy haired, but neatly dressed communications analyst Todd Seward.

"We have every cop on the ground looking, but they haven't found anybody matching her description," Todd replied. He paused, pressed a button on his headset, then added,  “Chief Mann is on line twelve for you.”

"I'll talk to him," Greg snapped. He picked up the line on the nearest phone. “Chief.”

"Mr. Black. My men are searching the business district, and the residential areas north of the campus. I still need more information on what we're looking for."

"All I can tell you that the suspect is female," Greg said. “And she should be considered to be very dangerous.”

"I'll let my officers know," Mann said. “How long before you can provide us drone support.”

"We have four drones over your area now; we can split them between the North and South end of town," Greg explained.

"Much appreciated," Mann said. “I'll keep you updated.”

"Todd, tell avionics to spread the drones evenly, and let me know the moment they see anything."

"Will do, sir," Todd responded. Greg turned and headed to his office.
